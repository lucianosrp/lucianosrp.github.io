## Intro

As [previously mentioned](/posts/switching-to-rust/#why-rust) in this blog, Rust is becoming more and more used in Python libraries such as Pydantic and Polars.But recently we are also getting python tools written in Rust! Few months ago, I followed the development of [Rye](https://rye-up.com/) as an alternative Python project and package manager. Later on, [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) made its debut as a linter and formatter substituting the popular [flake-8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) and [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

Thanks to their powerful backend written in Rust, these tools all provide a susbtanstial upgrade in terms of performance and flexibility compared to the tools they are aiming to replace (up to 100x faster). I have swiftly been decommissioning some of the tools I am using (anaconda, poetry,black) in favour of these ones and here are my first comments and reaction!

## Ruff
I found `ruff format` to be the easiest tool to replace. I often bind the reformat command to a shortcut or to reformat while saving. But more often, I tend to reformat the whole project before committing. The performance of Ruff allows me to confidently reformat thousands of lines knowing that I will not need to wait long. Also, ruff is very similar if not identical to black. I personally prefer how ruff handles comments in smaller code blocks and how it is able to even format docstrings!

Adopting `ruff format` together with `ruff check` in your pipelines can substantially reduces your actions time! 


## Rye
Even before Astral's ruff and uv were available, I got Rye a try. 
Rye was the first attempt to implement a "Cargo for Python" - a 360 degrees project and package management at your fingertips. I immediately found Rye very easy to use and, to some extent, similar to Poetry! However, the lack of implementations for VScode (at the time of testing) or Pycharm [^p] had made me reluctant to adopt it full time.

## Uv
Uv is the latest addition to the Rust-born Python family tools. It is the fastest package manager out there and is able to quickly resolve most of your painful package dependecies. It is also a replacement for `venv`, so you can quickly set up a new virtual environment for your Python project.

After Uv was released, Astral also announced the takeover of Rye and implemented uv as the core package manager for Rye [^r]


## What I use, what I am not using and what's next
I now fully use ruff on a daily basis both at work and for private projects. It so easy to use that I often forget it is running. 

Due to the current lack of support for Pycharm (the IDE I use at work) I am not currently using either Rye nor Uv at work, but I am still using them on my local machine for personal projects. 

I look forward to see what Astral is developing next - perhaps a "Clippy for Python" or a rust-based static type checker to substitute mypy ? Everything seems to be possible at this point. I am more and more confident that Rust is going to be an integral part of Python's future and will *finally* bring more comfort in everyone's personal journey while developing and learning Python.
